# No REST for the chicken

The Android application "Chicken Time" that i created currently downloads the lunch menu as an HTML file and then pases said document, fuguring out wether there is checkien or not(disapoint).
This is an attempt of creating a REST keeps track of the lunch menu and should uppdate the information weekly.
